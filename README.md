## 🔍 About

For your frontend, this application will be using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. You will learn how to maneuver around an app and build a strong static pricing page.

For your backend AND authentication, we will make use of Supabase. Supabase is open source and is all of the backend services that you will need to build your site. It includes a dedicated and scalable Postgres database and user management with Row Level Security!

Lastly, for payments, you will be using Stripe. It will be an individual payment checkout system that will create and update users' subscriptions.

Jon will take you through all of this and more in just 1 hour and 10 minutes!
