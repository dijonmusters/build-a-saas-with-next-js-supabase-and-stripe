**[📹 Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/next-js-create-a-next-js-app-with-tailwind-css)**

Next.js is a super efficient web development framework, built on React. It handles both client-side and server-side code, making it a great tool for most web apps.

In this video, we use the create-next-app package to create a new Next.js application, and use the with-tailwind argument to configure TailwindCSS.

Additionally, we remove the boilerplate markup, and run our application in development mode with npm run dev.
