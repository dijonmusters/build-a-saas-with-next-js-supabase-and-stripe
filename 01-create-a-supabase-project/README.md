**[📹 Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/supabase-create-a-supabase-project)**

Supabase is a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) that makes it super simple to create databases, tables, columns and input data.

Every project contains the infrastructure to handle database storage, authentication, authorization, file storage and real-time.

In this video, we look at setting up a Supabase project from scratch - creating an account, organisation and a project - with a geographically close region.
